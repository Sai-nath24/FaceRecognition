Facial recognition is a biometric security technology that uses a person's face to identify or verify their identity. The software maps facial features and stores the data as a faceprint. It then uses deep learning algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image to the stored faceprint.
Facial recognition can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. For example, law enforcement may use mobile devices to identify people during police stops. Facial recognition can also be used to authenticate transactions in banking.
Facial recognition can help verify a person's identity, but it also raises privacy issues. For example, social media and tech giants like Facebook and Google Photos use facial recognition to map a user to the face in a photo.
